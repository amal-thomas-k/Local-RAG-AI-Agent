## Local AI Agent with Ollama, LangChain and SingleStore
In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to build a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agent.

Once the agent starts running, ask any of these questions.

"What do customers say about the crust?"

"How is the sauce described in the reviews?"

"What do people think about the cheese?"

"Are the toppings fresh according to reviews?"

"Which pizzas get the highest ratings?"

"What are the most common complaints?"

"Which reviews mention value for money?"

"Are customers satisfied overall?"
